# Data Portability Layer

The [Data Portability Layer](./) or Application Layer is an open data playground for Data Contributors and developers to collaborate and build applications with the data liquidity amassed by DLPs. As the Data Liquidity Layer verifiably brings data on-chain, the Application Layer provides the infrastructure for the distributed training of user-owned foundation models and the development of novel AI dApps.

The Application Layer functions as an active data hub, where online communities can collaborate with developers to create real economic value from their data. This fosters an interactive data creation ecosystem, where data contributors benefit from the downstream network effects and value emerging from the intelligence that their data helps to create.
