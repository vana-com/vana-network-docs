# Connectome

The Connectome is a decentralized ledger of real-time data transactions throughout Vana’s ecosystem. Using proof-of-stake consensus, Connectome propogators propagate data transactions within the network. This ensures that DLP token transfers are valid and allows for cross-DLP data access by user-owned data applications.&#x20;

The Connectome allows external parties to view and monitor data transactions throughout the network. Moreover, the Connectome is EVM-compatible allowing for interoperability with other EVM networks, protocols, and DeFi applications.
