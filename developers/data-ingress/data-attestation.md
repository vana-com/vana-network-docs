# Data Attestation

Anyone can submit data to the Vana network. However, for data to be considered valid by a DLP, it must be attested for by a trusted party, i.e. [validators.md](../../core-concepts/roles/validators.md "mention") in a DLP. These trusted parties issue an attestation to prove that this data is, in fact, authentic, high-quality, unique, and has whatever other properties DLPs value in its data contributions.&#x20;

Data attestations live offchain, and a URL to a data's attestation is written onchain alongside the data itself.&#x20;

## Attestation Schema

The attestation of a data point must follow a spec. Attestations show relevant information about how the data was evaluated, proof-of-contribution scores, integrity checksums, and custom metadata relevant to a specific DLP.

An example of when this would be useful: consider a ChatGPT DLP that accepts GDPR exports from chatgpt.com. Say the DLP considers the export to be high quality when the number of conversations in the export exceeds 10. This DLP can insert `numberOfConversations: xxx` in the attestation when Proof of Contribution is run, and anyone can see how valuable that encrypted data point is.

### Schema

* **`signed_fields`** Contains the main data fields that are signed by the prover.
  * **`subject`** Information about the datapoint being attested for.
    * **`url`** URL where the encrypted file lives.
    * **`owner_address`** Wallet address of the file owner.
    * **`decrypted_file_checksum`** Checksum of the decrypted file for integrity verification.
    * **`encrypted_file_checksum`** Checksum of the encrypted file for integrity verification.
    * **`encryption_seed`** The message that was signed by the owner to retrieve the encryption key.
  * **`prover`** Information about the prover.
    * **`type`** Type of the prover, `satya` is one of the confidential TEE nodes in the Satya network. Proofs can also be `self-signed` where the data owner generates the proof.
    * **`address`** Wallet address of the prover.
    * **`url`** URL or address where the prover service is hosted.
  * **`proof`** Details about the generated proof.
    * **`image_url`** Docker image URL of where the instructions to generate the proof is downloaded from
    * **`created_at`** Timestamp of when the proof was created.
    * **`duration`** Duration of the proof generation process, in seconds.
    * **`dlp_id`** DLP ID from the [Root Network Contract](../smart-contracts.md#root-network-contract), this is used to tie the proof to a DLP.
    * **`valid`** Boolean indicating if the subject is valid.
    * **`score`** Overall score of the subject, from 0-1.
    * **`authenticity`** Authenticity score of the subject, from 0-1.
    * **`ownership`** Ownership score of the subject, from 0-1.
    * **`quality`** Quality score of the subject, from 0-1.
    * **`uniqueness`** Uniqueness score of the subject, from 0-1.
    * **`attributes`** Additional key/value pairs that will be available on the public proof. These can be used to quickly view properties about the encrypted subject.
* **`signature`** Generated by the prover signing a stringified representation of `signed_fields`, sorted by the key name. To verify it, we can take the signature and the striningifed representation, and extract the address that signed it, which should match the `prover.address`.
