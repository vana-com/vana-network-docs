# Data Contributors

Data Contributors are the foundation of the system, supplying the valuable data on which the network is built.&#x20;

#### **Participation:**

* Submit data to network DLPs for token rewards and governance rights.
* Allow personal data to be written onto the Vana network for use across different DLPs and user-owned data apps.
* Pay transaction fees in [$DAT](../../undefined/key-terms.md#data-autonomy-token-usddat) and additional fees to validators to maintain network stability.

Data Contributors provide their data to the network in return for DLP token rewards and ownership. Data contributors can also directly use their verified data in a dApp.&#x20;
