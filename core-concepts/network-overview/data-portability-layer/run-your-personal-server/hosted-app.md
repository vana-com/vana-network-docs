# Hosted App

We have partnered with Replicate to offer a hosted version of the personal server. It contains a personal vector database with your private information, an audio model trained on your voice, and an image model trained on your photos. You can create it through our consumer-friendly application at [`app.vana.com`](https://app.vana.com/). Note that there is a paywall to cover compute costs.

If you are a developer, you can use the development version at [`https://development-app.vana.com/`](https://development-app.vana.com/) , and bypass the paywall using the test card number `4242 4242 4242 4242`, choosing any future date for the expiry, and using any three digits for the CVC code. The development environment will be slower as there are fewer GPUs assigned.
